# ML-LocallyWeightedRegression
Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithm Locally Weighted Regression

# About
Locally weighted linear regression is a non-parametric algorithm, that is, the model does not learn a fixed set of parameters as is done in ordinary linear regression. Rather parameters θ are computed individually for each query point x. While computing θ, a higher “preference” is given to the points in the training set lying in the vicinity of x than the points lying far away from x.
